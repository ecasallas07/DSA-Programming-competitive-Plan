Asymptotic Analysis
The idea of the Asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of the eficiency  of algorithms that  don't depend  on machine-specific.

Asymptotic notation
Are mathematical tools  to represent  the time complexity  of algorithms for  asymptotic analysis.
- Asymptotic analysis allows for the comparison of algorithmsâ€™ space and time complexities by examining 
their performance characteristics as the input size varies.

Asymptotic notations
- Big O
- Big Omega
- Big theta

Theta notation
Encloses the function from above and below,it is used for analyzinf the average-case complexity of algorithm

Big notation
Represent the upper bound of the running time
